Gosh is an interpreted language for Go ecosystem written in Go.

It is in super-early pre-alpha stage. It is also an experiment in community building.
We are looking for the brave souls who are interested in contributing and be a subject of this experiment.
For everyone else: please check out this project from time to time to see when it moves to
the alpha/beta stage.
